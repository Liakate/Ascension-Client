# Ascension Client documentation (GitHub-friendly)

This repository combines:

1) **Interface wiki** (generated from the shipped `Interface/` package)
2) **Runtime scan results** (captured in-game and annotated)

## Start here

- [Docs index (HTML)](docs/index.html)
- [Interface overview (HTML)](docs/README.html)

## Runtime scan (HTML)

The `docs/RuntimeScan/` docs are the human-readable, GitHub-friendly write-ups of what was observed at runtime.

- [Runtime scan index (HTML)](docs/RuntimeScan/index.html)

## Bronzebeard Scan folder (HTML + raw exports)

The `Bronzebeard Scan/` folder contains the **v2 Bronzebeard Scan exports** (HTML indexes + raw Markdown/JSON dumps)
so you can browse the runtime surface quickly.

Entry points:

- [Bronzebeard Scan - API index (HTML)](Bronzebeard%20Scan/index_v2.html)
- [Bronzebeard Scan - Globals/UI objects index (HTML)](Bronzebeard%20Scan/globals_index_v2.html)

Raw exports:

- [API documentation (v2)](Bronzebeard%20Scan/API_DOCUMENTATION_v2.html)
- [Runtime objects (v2)](Bronzebeard%20Scan/API_DOCUMENTATION_v2_RUNTIME_OBJECTS.html)
- [Global UI objects (v2)](Bronzebeard%20Scan/GLOBAL_UI_OBJECTS_v2.html)
- [Object graph fields (v2)](Bronzebeard%20Scan/OBJECT_GRAPH_FIELDS_v2.html)
- [Evidence index (JSON)](Bronzebeard%20Scan/EvidenceIndex.json)
- [Globals index (JSON)](Bronzebeard%20Scan/GlobalsIndex.json)

> Tip: GitHub may not render local HTML reliably in the file viewer. If the HTML links don't display, download the repo
> and open the `index_v2.html` files locally, or view them via GitHub Pages.
